# Epson-Printer-Horizontal-Lines-Problem

In this article we bring you solution to a printer problem. When you print and see lines across the print output. The line going through your print and are not supposed to be there at all. This is a printer problem.

 

	First thing is check the ink. Go to maintenance and I do a print head check.

	If the print head requires cleaning and or alignment make sure these two processes are completed. If you still see line in the print output and cannot figure out try change the setting.

	It could be the rollers or maybe not. If this seems okay try to print again and before executing print click on preferences. Ensure paper sources is a match, its border versus board should match. You may try using another paper sources if required

	It is possible you have a wrong one chosen for e.g.: out print on glossy vs. Matt

	So change the paper source and then hit OK and then make sure you hit apply.

	It is possible you chose a setting but did not apply and hence the change was not put in to action by the printer. Check by test print if it prints without these lines.

	If your internet connection is slow be patient or do a straight connection with the help of a USB.

	Click yes for paper source, print and just look for those lines here and this should resolve your problem.
